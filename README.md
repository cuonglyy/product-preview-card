## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries


### What I learned

I was able to review my HTML and CSS concepts such as Flexbox and pseudo-classes.

### Continued development

I think I need to focus on making the website more responsive and clean. I had a rough time with the mobile design as the contents within the card container seemed to be cramped together.
